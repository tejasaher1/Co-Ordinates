# Shipment Journey Tracking Map

This project visualizes the shipment journey between a start location, an end location, and the current location of the shipment on an interactive map using Leaflet (a popular JavaScript library for maps). It connects the three coordinates with a smooth curved line to visually track the progress of the shipment.

This project demonstrates how to track a shipment’s journey between three points:

1. **Start Point**: The shipment's origin (e.g., Mumbai, India).
2. **Current Location**: Where the shipment is currently located (e.g., in the ocean near Africa).
3. **End Point**: The destination (e.g., New York, USA).

Using **Leaflet**, the journey is displayed on a map with markers representing the three coordinates and a curved line connecting them, providing a clear visual representation of the shipment’s route.

## Features

- Displays an interactive map using **Leaflet**.
- Visualizes the shipment journey between **start**, **current**, and **end** points.
- Draws a curved path between the points using the **Leaflet Curve plugin**.
- Markers for each point with customizable popups.
- Lightweight and responsive UI.
